    <p>
        carrot, (Daucus carota), herbaceous, generally biennial plant of the Apiaceae family that produces an edible taproot. Among common varieties root shapes range from globular to long, with lower ends blunt to pointed. Besides the orange-coloured roots,
        white-, yellow-, and purple-fleshed varieties are known. Discover the science behind consuming carrots and improving human eye vision Discover the science behind consuming carrots and improving human eye vision See all videos for this article
        Wild carrot (subspecies D. carota carota, also called Queen Anneâ€™s lace) is native to Eurasia and is thought to have been domesticated in Central Asia around 1000 CE. Prehistoric seeds have been found in archaeological digs, suggesting that the
        plant was used medicinally before the domestication of its edible root. Carrots were cultivated in China and northwestern Europe by the 13th century, and wild carrot was unintentionally distributed as a weed in the United States during European
        colonization. Domesticated carrots (subspecies D. carota sativus) are now extensively grown throughout temperate zones. In the 20th century, knowledge of the value of carotene (provitamin A) increased appreciation of the carrot, a rich source
        of the nutrient. The plants require cool to moderate temperatures and are not grown in summer in the warmer regions. They require deep, rich, but loosely packed soil. Modern machines sow the seeds sparsely in bands to give room for plant development
        without need for thinning. An erect rosette of doubly compound, finely divided leaves develops above ground normally in the first season. The edible carrot and attached roots are below. If left unharvested, the plant survives through the winter,
        and large branched flower stalks arise the following growing season. The tiny white or pinkish flowers are borne on large compound clusters (umbels) at the ends of the main stalk and branches. The spiny seeds are produced in small segmented fruits
        called schizocarps. Seeds that are sold for planting have the spines removed.

    <h1 class="Heading">Cultivation</h1>
    <p>Carrot can be grown well in cool area of up country regions. It can be cultivated in all the agro-ecological zones.
        <br>It need a finely prepared well drain soil with more organic matter.Plough up to depth of 30 cm and finely prepare soil before planning. Seed are plating on one-meter width raised beds.Row spacing is 25 cm, seedling thinning to 5 cm spacing.<br>        Organic manure 10 t/ha<br> Root enlargement stage of carrot is the most critical stage of water. Light, frequent irrigation is required to obtained good yield. Weed control can be done by manually or chemical method. Pre-emergent herbicide; metribuzin
        at the rate of 0.35 kg/ha apply before germination seedling.
