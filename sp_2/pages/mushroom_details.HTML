    <p>
        Mushrooms are classed as a superfood as they are high in nutrients and have many health benefits. You could eat mushrooms every day if you wish, although only as part of a balanced diet with other foods. Although mushrooms come in all shapes and sizes,
        the nutrients they provide per 96g serving are very similar
